# Phylogentic_supertrees

This is the code for an implementation of an approximation algorithm for qMAXRTC. This was completed as a final project for CS 4775 at Cornell during the Fall 2019 semester.

The file `qmaxrtc.py` is the main project file. It is currently configured to run an experiment by running the algorithm on the trees in the data files `datai.txt` where i=1,2,3,4,5. 

The file `Computational_Genetics_Final_Paper.pdf` is a writeup of the final project.
